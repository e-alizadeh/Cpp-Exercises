## BinarySearch.cpp
This file implements the _Binary Search Algorithm_ on an array of integers.  
* **Time Complexity: O(log n)**   (n: number of elements in an array)

The following Binary Search algorithms are implemented:
* Finding an element in an integer array,
* Finding the first occurrence of an element in an integer array,
* Finding the last occurrence of an element in an integer array.
---

## SelectionSort.cpp
This file implements the _Selection Sort Algorithm_ on an array of integers.  
* **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**   (n: number of elements in an array)
---

## BubbleSort.cpp
This file implements the _Bubble Sort Algorithm_ on an array of integers.  
* **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**   (n: number of elements in an array)
* A more efficient version of Bubble Sort Algorithm (still O(n^2)) is also implemented.

## FibonacciSequence.cpp
This file calculates the _Fibonacci Sequence_ for an integer n using the following three methods.  
1. Recursive method
2. Iterative method
3. Recusion with Memoization
